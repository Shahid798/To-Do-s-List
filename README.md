# Getting Started with To Do's list

This web app is created form scratch from basic react functionalities, some part consists of React Hoooks, props, localstorage.

I have used a free web hosting platform Netlify for hosting my website, really helpful to such free service providers for helping learners.

#Service

make this as your daily web app, create your routine, set out your goals and don't worry the data isn't volatile so you can use the list for longer time
